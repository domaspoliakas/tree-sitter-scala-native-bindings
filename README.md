# Tree-sitter for scala native

A library to make it easy for you to use treesitter from scala native. Will probably go nowhere but who knows!

### Testing

In order to test it you need to initialise the `tree-sitter` submodule and build it: `git submodule init && git submodule update && cd tree-sitter && make`
